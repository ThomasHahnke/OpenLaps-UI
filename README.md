# OpenLaps-UI
A basic powershell project to pull LAPS credentials. The reason for this project was to provide folks with a version of the LAPS UI with a larger and more distinguishable font.
To create an executable I used https://github.com/MScholtes/PS2EXE with the following arguements ps2exe .\OpenLAPS_UI.ps1 -noOutput -noConsole -version 1
